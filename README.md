This command finds commands in the system PATH using regular expressions

 - You can use you own debugging tools but I recommend valgrind and gdb to debug your executable(s)
 - To beautify the code you can use uncrustify(The code beautifier for C). On some distributions this command does not exist. I recommend to use uncrustify/linux.cfg as the default uncrustify config because it is a small derivative of uncrustify examples with a litle customizations.
 - You can download the uncrustify source and compile it yourself. <http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncrustify/files/>
 - There are small scripts in the scripts/ directory you can use them to manage
code yourself
